#### Background and history of JS & node.js
* JavaScript has Javascript engine which converts JS code to M/C language which browser can understand

* This Javascript engine are individual to each browser. That means chrome will have its own engine, internet explorer 
will have it own. It was observed V8 JS engine of chrome can very fastly convert JS to m/c code and run JS faster.
That's when JS started getting popular & thought of to be used for other purposes.

* They used V8 JS engine to build local runtime env for JS to run. Hence, doing so, node can run any js file on m/c (not the browser)

#### Popular JS Frameworks - 
Front end : React, Angular

Mobile development: React native

Back end: Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Hence, now we can full stack development using JS, called as MERN development

#### Nutshell
* So, in nutshell, Node.js is javascript runtime environment which is build on V8 JS engine.

* A package manager is available for node js to manage all dependencies & modules. Its called node package manager. __*npm*__
